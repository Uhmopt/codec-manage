            If it didn't work here's the manual process to do so :
            <br/>
            1. Exit All adobe softwares
            <br/>
            2. Delete this folder :
            <br/>
            (Windows) <code>C:\Program Files\Adobe\Common\Plug-ins\7.0\MediaCore\BRAW Studio</code>
            <br/>
            (Mac OS) <code>/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/Plug-ins/7.0/MediaCore/Autokroma BRAW Studio</code>
            <br/>
            3. Delete folder named <code>com.autokroma.brawStudioPanelVisible</code> in this folder (delete also <code>com.autokroma.brawStudioPanelHidden</code> if you find it !) :
            <br/>
            (Windows) <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions</code>
            <br/>
            (Mac OS) <code>/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions</code>
            <br/>
            4. Relaunch your Adobe softwares
            <br/>
            If you performed a manual installation of BRAW Studio yourself you need to look for "BRAW_Studio" and delete all related files !

            You can export proxies and convert (Right click -> Export Media) your .BRAW directly from Adobe Premiere Pro and it will open up Media Encoder for conversion.

          "How is the Sidecar workflow and Decode Using Camera Metadata ?",
          <>
            .BRAW imported into Adobe Media Encoder are decoded by default with the "Camera Metadata" setting, like on DaVinci Resolve. This means that it will try to read the <code>.sidecar</code> next to your <code>.braw</code> to apply the color grade. If it can't find it, it will use the settings from your Camera when you shot the footage. If you changed the <code>.sidecar</code> after importing the footage, it will keep the same old <code>.sidecar</code> values until your restart Media Encoder / Premiere Pro.

            When you send a project or a <code>.braw</code> clip from Premiere Pro to Media Encoder's render queue, it will act as a dynamic link between the two softwares; this means the render will look <strong>exactly the same as it looked like on Premiere Pro</strong> (i.e. it will take Exposure, ISO, Color Balance, Contrast etc. from the Source Settings). See previous answer if you import your <code>.braw</code> from Media Encoder's UI

            The simplest to fix this issue to install again Blackmagic Design's Adobe plugin. If you're now using BRAW Studio you will have a missing Source Settings filter in the Master tab of your .BRAW and won't be able to retrieve your Source Settings color grade.

          "How do I set different RAW settings on the same .braw ?",

            The way Source Settings works in Premiere Pro is to modify all instances of the same clips on all timelines, so any change will affect all instance of the same <code>.braw</code> imported. This is only an issue on Premiere Pro because on After Effects you have the Layer Settings filter that is applying the RAW parameters on the current layer and not the source.
            <strong>The best way to apply different RAW settings on the same footage on Premiere Pro is to use the BRAW Studio Panel feature</strong> : "Set New Source". You just need to select a clip and click on the button in the BRAW Studio Panel !

            If you want to do it manually, you have 2 choices  :
            1. Import the same footage many times (as much as you need different color corrections on this footage) and change each Source Settings 
            2. Or Use the "SubClip" feature, <Link href={"https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/subclips-premiere-pro/"}>see this article</Link> :

Same for "Trillion of Colors" : 16bits would be always asked for 8bits and 16bits and that would also involve performance issues. 
            For us, the current behavior is the best : if you configure your project in 8bits, then After Effects will ask 8bits to our importer, and same respectively for 16bits and 32bits. Sadly, the description will stay as "Million of Colors" even if it's true only in 8bits.
