You already purchased a PlumePack Basic license and you want to upgrade your license to Premium? 
In this article you will learn how to do it.

# Why should you update to PlumePack ?

Upgrading PlumePack from Basic to Premium will allow you to use the special "Trim" feature of PlumePack !

Trimming will remove the unused frames from your medias : you will get a lighter project and save disk space, without re-encoding so without any lost quality and by keeping your media codecs!

# Infos about Upgrading

If you have already purchased a license for PlumePack Basic and you want to upgrade to PlumePack Premium, you only need to pay the difference.

You cannot upgrade from Basic to Premium if you didn't license with a Basic license first. It cannot work. You need to enter both licenses. **If you don't have a Basic license you shouldn't buy an upgrade but you can buy the full product**. 


# If you bought from Autokroma.com

All you'll need to do is to enter the new license in the Settings & License popup with a Basic license being registered, and it will then convert your licenses to a PlumePack Premium license.
