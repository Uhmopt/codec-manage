In this article you will learn how to trim your BRAW files in Premiere Pro !

# What does Trimming mean ?

Trimming is like copying a part of your footage. It will remove the frames before an InPoint and after an OutPoint set for the footage, while keeping all the file metadata and Source Settings.

# Trim you BRAW file with the BRAW Studio Panel

If you don't know about the BRAW Studio Source Settings Panel, please check <Link href={"/blog/BRAW-Studio-Source-Settings-Panel/"}>this article</Link> to know everything about it.

## Choose the BRAW file and trim bounds

First, you will need to select a BRAW file in your timeline or in the Project Panel.

Then you will need to open this BRAW file in the Source Monitor. For this, at the top of the panel you can click on the "To Src Monitor" button, but you can also double click on a BRAW file in the Project Panel. Double clicking on a clip in your timeline will not work because it will open the Clip and not the Project Item in the Source Monitor.

The In/Out points set in the Source Monitor (see picture bellow) will represent the bounds of the exported trimmed BRAW file.

## Trim you BRAW !

Once the In/Out are chosen from the Source Monitor, you just need to click on the "Trim BRAW" button at the bottom of the BRAW Studio Panel on the Source Settings tab. 

The BRAW Settings currently set in the Source Settings Panel will be exported into a sidecar next to the BRAW file (so those values should be automatically loaded by any player if the sidecar file is still present next to the file).

If a sidecar file is present next to the original file, the values inside this sidecar file will be baked into the "Camera Metadata" values of the trimmed BRAW.

Note : SubClip with hard boundaries are not supported.
