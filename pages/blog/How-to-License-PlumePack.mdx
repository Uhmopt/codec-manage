Here are the steps after downloading the plugin and testing the free trial: 

# Retrieve License after Purchase

The first step after purchasing <Link href={"/PlumePack"}>PlumePack</Link> is to retrieve your license. If you bought it here on this website you should have received the code on the purchase confirmation page and by email; for example it would look like this:

<BlogImage src={require("assets/images/_PP/PP_License/Autokroma_PlumePack_Screenshot_License_FastSpring.JPG")} hasShadow />

Your license key will be in bold blue text as seen above, please copy it and move on to the next step. If you can't find the email we sent you with the license <Link href={"/Send_My_License_Email"}>you can request we send you again the license on this page.</Link>

If you bought it on aescripts + aeplugins, a different reseller, please follow <Link href={"/blog/Retrieve-Your-License-From-aescripts"}>this article</Link>.

In order to remove the <Link href={"/PlumePack"}>PlumePack</Link> trial limit, you'll need to license it in the Settings popup: this is where you'll also find the PlumePack global settings (such as writing logs).

# How to License PlumePack

Once you have your license code, you need to enter it from the "Settings &amp; License" popup.

1. In the Settings tab you can paste the license you copied at the first step. If you're on Mac Mac OS you can use the "Paste Clipboard" button because <code>COMMAND</code>+<code>V</code> is not working.
2. Click the Activate button. Please note you can enter any license for any Autokroma product here
3. Click OK and restart Premiere Pro and you shouldn't be in Trial mode anymore
