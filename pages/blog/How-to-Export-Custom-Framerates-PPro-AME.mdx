# What is AfterCodecs?

AfterCodecs is a new native plugin for the whole Adobe CC Video suite, working on both MacOS and Windows. It brings fast and efficient codecs to After Effects’ render queue and a new <i>Format</i> choice in Premiere Pro and Media Encoder's <i>Export</i> Window. AfterCodecs also removes a lot of the limitations that are found in regular Premiere Pro, including letting you export whatever framerate you require.

When working with high speed video or delivering to a custom display, it is often necessary to export video at a high or simply unconventional framerate. The options for this in Premiere Pro and Media Encoder are limited to certain presets that are all below 60 FPS. AfterCodecs solves this issue by allowing you to export whatever FPS you require, with no limit. This article will walk you through that process.

# Selecting your Export Settings
In Premiere Pro, select the sequence you would like to export and go to <i>File</i> &gt; <i>Export</i> &gt; <i>Media</i>. This will open your export settings.
In Media Encoder, once you have a sequence queued for export, click on the button in the <i>Format</i> column to open your export settings.

From this point onwards, the process is exactly the same for both applications.
Select AfterCodecs in the <i>Format</i> drop-down menu and, under the <i>Video</i> tab, select your desired container: <code>H.264</code> or <code>.MOV</code>.

Then click on <i>Open AfterCodecs Settings</i> to select your codec and other export settings. For more information about exporting specific codecs, check out our <Link href={"/blog"}>other articles</Link>.

Once all your desired AfterCodecs options have been selected, click <i>OK</i> on the AfterCodecs panel.

# Choosing your custom FPS

Under the <i>Video</i> tab, go down to <i>Video Settings</i> to access your framerate options. As you can see below, the custom FPS option will be grayed out by default.

To access the custom FPS, click on the framerate drop-down menu and select <i>Custom</i>.

Now you are able to enter whatever FPS you desire.

Click <i>Export</i> in PrPro or the play button in AME and you’re done!
