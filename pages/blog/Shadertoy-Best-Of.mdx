Image sequences were rendered from Google Chrome and edited in Adobe After Effects. The final video was exported in Ultra HD (8K 50 fps) directly from After Effects <Link href={"/aftercodecs/"}>with our plugin AfterCodecs</Link> in the H.264 codec.

## What are shaders ?

Shaders are little programs that run on your GPU : everything you see in this video has been generated by code and a few textures in input. No modeling software or precoded 3D engine has been used by theses artists, as the models and the 3D engine are contained in theirs codes (thus they all use their own methods for creating 3D scenes). Only the GLSL language from OpenGL has been used.
