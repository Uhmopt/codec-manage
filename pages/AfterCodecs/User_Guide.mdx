            On Windows you should run your cmd.exe or Powershell in Administrator Mode, then run AfterCodecs installer executable with the <code>/S</code> argument, for example in Powershell : <code>./"AfterCodecs v1.9.7 Installer.exe" /S</code> if you're in the extracted folder from the downloaded zip

                    <code>ffkroma</code> executable is built-in the installer of AfterCodecs in recent versions so you don't need to download it manually or from the Settings tab. Just <Link href={"/Download"}>download again the installer</Link> to update to the latest version!

                    Select "[A] Hap" or "[A] Hap Q" and export in RGB in the AE settings. Exporting in <code>RGB+Alpha</code> on AE (or ticking <code>Export Alpha Channel</code> on PPro / AME) will automatically switch the codec to Hap Alpha or Hap Q Alpha!
