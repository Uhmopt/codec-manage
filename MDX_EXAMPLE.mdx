# Incorrect MDX

## Example 1

<Box>
    - Markdown syntax doesn't work inside of React
    - It will be rendered as plain text
    - It won't throw an error
</Box>

## How to fix it

Add empty line inside of react component

<Box>

    - Markdown syntax doesn't work inside of React
    - It will be rendered as plain text
    - It won't throw an error
    
</Box>


## Example 2

<Box>
    Don't leave empty lines inside of React components

    <Box>This won't throw an error, but will be rendered as plain text. Not expected behavior. Because of empty line above.</Box>
</Box>

## ^^^ How to fix top example ^^^

<Box>
    Simply remove empty line
    <Box>That's better!</Box>
</Box>

## Example 3

<Link href={"https://google.com"}>this link will work</Link> but you can't write markdown `here`. so if you start your line with React you have to finish it in react.

## ^^^ How to fix top example ^^^

<Link href={"https://google.com"}>this link will work</Link>

`or`

Wrap line in parental element like `<p>`:

<p><Link href={"https://google.com"}>this link will work</Link> but you can't write markdown `here`. so if you start your line with React you have to finish it in react.</p>

_Important_ to have one empty line in between. This markdown *will work*
